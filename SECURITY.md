# Security Policy
>You cannot and should not create fake bugs to manipulate other people's information for their own or use user list links to redirect electronic wallets, which are currently supported by law to deal with offenders in many governments around the world. When they give themselves the opportunity to become developers, keep in mind that "when they have easier access to information than others, they will be punished more severely than the general public because developers have credibility in their honesty and integrity in doing all the work they do, not in the hope of stealing others' work or secretly hacking others' interests by security attacks." If you think about making a mistake in the first place, "Don't become a developer to destroy the honor of the developer they truly want to develop

## Reporting a Vulnerability
>Don't attempt to report fake vulnerabilities to deceive systems or investigators in hopes of gaining access to someone else's data or create false reports to attack other users. Reporting must only be a true vulnerability report, when someone is detected or harmed by that false report, you will be punished twice or several times because of multiple offences in a single case. For those who find real vulnerabilities, you can report them to the address in the next account without worrying about you being exposed because the team is sincere in fixing them to make the online world a real better place
