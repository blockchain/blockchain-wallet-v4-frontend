# Blockchain.com Wallet
Be Your Own Bank at [login.blockchain.com](https://login.blockchain.com).
Please [contact support](https://support.blockchain.com) if you have any issues using the wallet.

## About
This repo contains the three codebases/packages listed below.

### Packages
 * [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components) The shared UI components library.
 * [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4) The functional library for handling wallets.
 * [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend) The frontend application built with React/Redux.


## Local Development
1. Ensure Node version >= 14.16 is installed. Using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended.
2. From the project root, run the following command to install dependencies: `./setup.sh`.
4. Start the application in development mode: `yarn start`
5. The frontend application will now be accessible via browser at `localhost:8080`

If you require the application to run locally over HTTPS, follow the instructions [here](./config/ssl/ssl.md).
You can disable SSL by setting the `DISABLE_SSL` env param to `true` with any start command. (e.g. `DISABLE_SSL=true yarn start:staging`)

### Windows Support
To ensure proper support for Windows, please take the following actions before running the above setup instructions.
1. Open a Powershell window with rights elevated to an Administrator.
2. Run `npm install -g windows-build-tools`. This will install Python 2.7 and Visual C++ Build Tools which are required to compile some native Node modules.
3. Ensure Python has been added to your environment variables by opening a cmd prompt and typing `python`. If you get a `CommandNotFoundException` message, add the folder `%USERPROFILE%\.windows-build-tools\python27` to your environment variables.

### Tips & Useful Commands
1. To completely remove all dependencies and artifacts run `yarn clean`
2. To add/remove an NPM package run `yarn add` or `yarn remove` in the package folder. After installing or uninstalling a NPM package, run `yarn` in the root folder to re-init the project
3. All development specific dependencies should be installed as a `dev-dependency` in the top level `package.json` via `yarn i --save-dev [package-name]`
4. All application specific dependencies should be installed in the specific packages `package.json` via `yarn i --save [package-name]`

### Running Environments Locally
The frontend application can be ran locally with different build configurations found in `config/env`.  The following commands are available:
 * `yarn start` Runs the application with the `development.js` configuration file
 * `yarn start:dev` Runs the application with the `development.js` configuration file
 * `yarn start:staging` Runs the application with the `staging.js` configuration file
 * `yarn start:prod` Runs the application with the `production.js` configuration file
 * `yarn run:prod` Runs the application mimicking the production environment entirely (i.e. code is bundled and minified, HMR is disabled,
  Express server is used (`./server.js`) and the `production.js` configuration file is loaded)

Notes:
 * Developers will need to manually create the `development.js` and `staging.js` files
 * Custom application runtimes are possible by modifying the corresponding environment files found in the `config/env` folder
 
### Useful Chrome Extensions
 * [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) Inspect the React component tree
 * [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) View/debug Redux state changes

## Release Process
#### Prerequisites
To be able to create a release follow these steps starting with "Obtain a personal access token...": 
https://github.com/release-it/release-it#github-releases

`GITHUB_TOKEN` should be saved as `RELEASE_IT_TOKEN` instead in your bash_profile or wherever you keep env variables

You'll need git changelog to generate the history since the last release:
`npm install -g changelog`

#### Release Steps
1) From the tip of the `development` branch, run `yarn release`
2) Answer the questions prompted via CLI, accepting the defaults for each
3) Once completed, this will create a new tag which will trigger a builds
4) Once builds have finished, deploy the images to desired environments
5) Test and verify the latest changes in desired environments
6) Create PR to merge the HEAD of `development` into `master`
7) Merge PR to `master` so that `master` always reflects what is currently in production

## Code Quality
 * `yarn vet` Runs Prettier, lint JS, lint CSS and finally all unit tests

### Linting
We follow the rules outlined by the [Javascript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) as well as a few React specific rules.

Code linting is handled by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). The following commands are available:
 * `yarn lint` Lints all packages
 * `yarn lint:components` Lints only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
 * `yarn lint:core` Lints only [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4)
 * `yarn lint:frontend` Lints only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)
 * `yarn lint:fix` Automatically resolves fixable issues via ESLint

These IDE plugins/packages assist with complying with these lint rules while developing:
 * [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard)
 * [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenxsan.vscode-standardjs)
 * [WebStorm](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2017/04/using-javascript-standard-style/)
 
### Prettier
We follow all standard rules that are provided by Prettier. The following commands are available:

 * `yarn prettier` Runs Prettier against all packages
 * `yarn prettier:components` Runs Prettier against only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
 * `yarn prettier:core` Runs Prettier against only [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4)
 * `yarn prettier:frontend` Runs Prettier against only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)
 
It is recommended to setup a Prettier plugin for your IDE plugins/packages that will automatically prettify your files on save.
 * [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/prettier-atom)
 * [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
 * [WebStorm](https://prettier.io/docs/en/webstorm.html)
 
 *When installing the plugin for VS Code make sure you are on [v3.7.0 or lower](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode/issues/1085#issuecomment-557027886)*
 
### Unit Tests
Testing is done via [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

#### Running Tests
 * `yarn test` Runs unit tests for all packages
 * `yarn test:components` Runs unit tests for only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
 * `yarn test:core` Runs unit tests for only [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4)
 * `yarn test:frontend` Runs unit tests for only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)
 
 _Note: if you see errors that Jest cannot resolve package imports, you may need to run `yarn test` before testing specific packages (eg, `yarn test:frontend`)_

#### Running Tests via Watch
 * `yarn test:watch` Watches and then runs desired tests
 * `yarn test:components:watch` Watches and then runs desired tests for only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
 * `yarn test:core:watch` Watches and then runs desired tests for only [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4)
 * `yarn test:frontend:watch` Watches and then runs desired tests for only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)

#### Debugging Tests
To enable debugging for unit tests via the Chrome browser, run the following commands:
 * `yarn test:components:debug` Debugs unit tests for only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
 * `yarn test:core:debug` Debugs unit tests for only [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4)
 * `yarn test:frontend:debug` Debugs unit tests for only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)

After running one of the above commands, Node will wait for a debugger to attach before starting the tests.
To attach, simply open your browser and go to `chrome://inspect` and click on "Open Dedicated DevTools for Node",
which will give you a list of available node instances you can connect to. Click on the address displayed in the terminal
(usually localhost:9229) and you will be able to debug tests using Chrome's DevTools.

#### Updating Snapshot Tests
We are snapshot testing UI some components. Here are the commands to update them when necessary:
 * `yarn test:components:update` Updates component snapshots for only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
 * `yarn test:frontend:update` Updates component snapshots for only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)

### Code Coverage
To generate code coverage reports via [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/), the following commands are available:
 * `yarn coverage` Generates a coverage report for all packages
 * `yarn coverage:components` Generates coverage report for only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
 * `yarn coverage:core` Generates coverage report for only [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4)
 * `yarn coverage:frontend` Generates coverage report for only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)

Depending upon which coverage report was ran, the results can be found in the following directories:
 * `coverage/index.html`
 * `coverage/blockchain-info-components/index.html`
 * `coverage/blockchain-wallet-v4/index.html`
 * `coverage/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend/index.html`
Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to view.

## TypeScript
TypeScript is supported and should be used when adding new code. It's also recommended to replace legacy JS with TS when time allows.

### TS Coverage
We are using [Codechecks](https://www.codechecks.io/) and [Typecov](https://github.com/codechecks/typecov) for coverage reporting. Coverage is automatically analyzed for PRs and the following command is available.
* `yarn codechecks`

## Code Bundle Analysis/Reports
To visualize and interact with the tree of the production code bundles files:
 * `yarn analyze`
Once completed, a browser will automatically open with the results.

## Storybook
[Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) is used by the [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components) and [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend) packages to interactively view, develop and test components.
The following commands are available:
 * `storybook:build-wallet`: Builds the static storybook assets for wallet specific components (if base components is running locally, storybook will put wallet and base components into the same storybook UI)
 * `storybook:build-base`: Builds the static storybook assets for base shared components
 * `storybook:serve-wallet` Builds storybook assets and then serves them locally at `localhost:6006`
 * `storybook:serve-base` Builds storybook assets and then serves them locally at `localhost:6007`
 * `storybook:deploy-wallet` Builds storybook assets and then serves them to [github pages](https://blockchain.github.io/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend). **You will probably need to run `cd ./packages/blockchain-info-components && git remote add origin git@github.com:blockchain/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend.git` first.**
 * `storybook:deploy-base` Builds storybook assets and then serves them to [github pages](https://blockchain.github.io/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend). **You will probably need to run `cd ./packages/blockchain-info-components && git remote add origin git@github.com:blockchain/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend.git` first.**

If the deploy begins to fail, deleting the static build file before redeploy will likely help.
