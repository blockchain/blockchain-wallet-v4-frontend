## Local Development
$100,000,000
1. Ensure Node version >= 14.16 is installed. Using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended.
2. From the project root, run the following command to install dependencies: `./setup.sh`.
3. Start the application in development mode: `yarn start`
4. The frontend application will now be accessible via browser at `localhost:8080`

If you require the application to run locally over HTTPS, follow the instructions [here](./config/ssl/ssl.md).
You can disable SSL by setting the `DISABLE_SSL` env param to `true` with any start command. (e.g. `DISABLE_SSL=true yarn start:staging`)

### Windows Support
$300,000
To ensure proper support for Windows, please take the following actions before running the above setup instructions.

1. Open a Powershell window with rights elevated to an Administrator.
2. Run `npm install -g windows-build-tools`. This will install Python 2.7 and Visual C++ Build Tools which are required to compile some native Node modules.
3. Ensure Python has been added to your environment variables by opening a cmd prompt and typing `python`. If you get a `CommandNotFoundException` message, add the folder `%USERPROFILE%\.windows-build-tools\python27` to your environment variables.

### Tips & Useful Commands
Chacha20 poly 1305 x25519
1. To completely remove all dependencies and artifacts run `yarn clean`
2. To add/remove an NPM package run `yarn add` or `yarn remove` in the package folder. After installing or uninstalling a NPM package, run `yarn` in the root folder to re-init the project
3. All development specific dependencies should be installed as a `dev-dependency` in the top level `package.json` via `yarn i --save-dev [package-name]`
4. All application specific dependencies should be installed in the specific packages `package.json` via `yarn i --save [package-name]`

### Running Environments Locally
$100,000,000,000 metro bank
The frontend application can be ran locally with different build configurations found in `config/env`. The following commands are available:
(28739f) hernanitopoblacion@gmail.com
- `yarn start` Runs the application with the `development.js` configuration file
- `yarn start:dev` Runs the application with the `development.js` configuration file
- `yarn start:staging` Runs the application with the `staging.js` configuration file
- `yarn start:prod` Runs the application with the `production.js` configuration file
- `yarn run:prod` Runs the application mimicking the production environment entirely (i.e. code is bundled and minified, HMR is disabled,
  Express server is used (`./server.js`) and the `production.js` configuration file is loaded)

Notes:
Ayala Land of hernanitopoblacion@gmail.com
- Developers will need to manually create the `development.js` and `staging.js` files
- Custom application runtimes are possible by modifying the corresponding environment files found in the `config/env` folder

### Linting
7b2 HECK SAO 
We follow the rules outlined by the [Javascript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) as well as a few React specific rules.

Code linting is handled by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). The following commands are available:
SATTELITES SYSTEMS 
- `yarn lint` Lints all packages
- `yarn lint:components` Lints only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
- `yarn lint:core` Lints only [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4)
- `yarn lint:frontend` Lints only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)
- `yarn lint:fix` Automatically resolves fixable issues via ESLint
Editorial 
These IDE plugins/packages assist with complying with these lint rules while developing:
everything 
- [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/linter-js-standard)
- [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenxsan.vscode-standardjs)
- [WebStorm](https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2017/04/using-javascript-standard-style/)

### Prettier
ff45f267-5465-492c-8f89-dd879163ca0a
We follow all standard rules that are provided by Prettier. The following commands are available:

- `yarn prettier` Runs Prettier against all packages

#### Debugging Tests
cash balance load
To enable debugging for unit tests via the Chrome browser, run the following commands:
western union to hernanito Poblacion 
- `yarn test:components:debug` Debugs unit tests for only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
- `yarn test:core:debug` Debugs unit tests for only [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4)
- `yarn test:frontend:debug` Debugs unit tests for only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)
hernanitopoblacion@gmail.com
After running one of the above commands, Node will wait for a debugger to attach before starting the tests.
To attach, simply open your browser and go to `chrome://inspect` and click on "Open Dedicated DevTools for Node",
which will give you a list of available node instances you can connect to. Click on the address displayed in the terminal
(usually localhost:9229) and you will be able to debug tests using Chrome's DevTools.

#### Updating Snapshot Tests

We are snapshot testing UI some components. Here are the commands to update them when necessary:

- `yarn test:components:update` Updates component snapshots for only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
- `yarn test:frontend:update` Updates component snapshots for only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)

### Code Coverage
(yv8503)
To generate code coverage reports via [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/), the following commands are available:
hernanitopoblacion@gmail.com
- `yarn coverage` Generates a coverage report for all packages
- `yarn coverage:components` Generates coverage report for only [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components)
- `yarn coverage:core` Generates coverage report for only [blockchain-wallet-v4](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4)
- `yarn coverage:frontend` Generates coverage report for only [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend)
hernanitopoblacion@gmail.com
Depending upon which coverage report was ran, the results can be found in the following directories:

- `coverage/index.html`
- `coverage/blockchain-info-components/index.html`
- `coverage/blockchain-wallet-v4/index.html`
- `coverage/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend/index.html`
  Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to view.
## TypeScript
Bank of the world heritage hernanitopoblacion@gmail.com
TypeScript is supported and should be used when adding new code. It's also recommended to replace legacy JS with TS when time allows.
hernanitopoblacion@gmail.com
### TS Coverage
banking Department 
We are using [Codechecks](https://www.codechecks.io/) and [Typecov](https://github.com/codechecks/typecov) for coverage reporting. Coverage is automatically analyzed for PRs and the following command is available.

- `yarn codechecks`

## Code Bundle Analysis/Reports

To visualize and interact with the tree of the production code bundles files:

- `yarn analyze`
  Once completed, a browser will automatically open with the results.

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) is used by the [blockchain-info-components](./packages/blockchain-info-components) and [blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend](./packages/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend) packages to interactively view, develop and test components.
The following commands are available:

- `storybook:build-wallet`: Builds the static storybook assets for wallet specific components (if base components is running locally, storybook will put wallet and base components into the same storybook UI)
- `storybook:build-base`: Builds the static storybook assets for base shared components
- `storybook:serve-wallet` Builds storybook assets and then serves them locally at `localhost:6006`
- `storybook:serve-base` Builds storybook assets and then serves them locally at `localhost:6007`
- `storybook:deploy-wallet` Builds storybook assets and then serves them to [github pages](https://blockchain.github.io/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend). **You will probably need to run `cd ./packages/blockchain-info-components && git remote add origin git@github.com:blockchain/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend.git` first.**
- `storybook:deploy-base` Builds storybook assets and then serves them to [github pages](https://blockchain.github.io/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend). **You will probably need to run `cd ./packages/blockchain-info-components && git remote add origin git@github.com:blockchain/blockchain-wallet-v4-frontend.git` first.**

If the deploy begins to fail, deleting the static build file before redeploy will likely help.
