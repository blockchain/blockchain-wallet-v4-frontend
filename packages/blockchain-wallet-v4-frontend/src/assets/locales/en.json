  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question1": "How do I receive/send funds?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer1": "To receive funds, the sender needs your address. Your wallet will automatically generate a new address for each bitcoin or bitcoin cash transaction you make. For all ether transactions, your address will remain the same. Click on ‘Request’, select the currency you’d like to receive from the dropdown, and copy the address to share with the sender. To send funds, click ‘Send’, select the currency you want to send from the dropdown, and enter the recipient’s address in the ‘To’ field and enter how much you would like to send.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question2": "How much does it cost to send funds?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer2": "While our wallet is entirely free to use, the small fee included in your transaction goes to the miners, who help power the flow of transactions on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash networks. To ensure your transactions confirm consistently and reliably, your wallet will automatically include an appropriate fee based on your transaction’s size and the level of network traffic at the time. If you wish to specify your own fee for bitcoin transactions, you can do so under ‘Customize Fee’.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question3": "What is the difference between a wallet ID and an address?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question5": "Why do we generate new addresses for each Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash transaction?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer5": "Although you can reuse addresses, transacting with the same address makes it easy for people to track your payments history. We alleviate this by using a HD (hierarchical deterministic) framework which provides you endless different addresses to send and receive to for additional security.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question6": "Can an address still receive funds even though it’s no longer displayed under ‘Request’?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer6.one": "Yes. All public addresses generated from your wallet can still receive funds, even if they no longer appear under ‘Request’. As explained ",

  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question7": "How do I know if a transaction has been successfully received/sent?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer7": "Transactions will appear almost instantly in your transaction feed. Each currency has its own feed, which you can find by clicking on the corresponding currency in the left navigation of your wallet. While your bitcoin and bitcoin cash transactions are considered complete once they have 3 network confirmations, your ether transactions will be considered complete after 12 confirmations. This typically takes about 30 minutes for bitcoin and bitcoin cash and 5 minutes for ether, but can vary. Until then, your transaction will show up as pending.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question8": "Can my transaction be canceled or reversed?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer8.one": "No, unfortunately we are unable to cancel or reverse any transaction. Even advanced cryptocurrency users can recall an incident when they failed to double-check their transaction details and accidentally sent funds to the wrong recipient, or sent the wrong amount. As unfortunate as it is, cryptocurrency transactions on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash networks are designed to be       irreversible and we have no control over them. Knowing this, it is extremely important to make sure your transaction details are correct before you click send.",

  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer8.three": ".",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer9.two": "An unconfirmed transaction will eventually either be accepted into a block by a mining pool, or be rejected by the network. If it is eventually rejected, the funds will remain on the address they were sent from. At this point, we can only recommend that you wait to see if your transaction is accepted into a block. Clicking the ⬆ icon in your transaction feed will relay to you the details of thattransaction through its respective explorer.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer9.three": "We do everything we can to lessen the number of pending transactions.

  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question12": "Why did my bitcoin cash address change?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer12": "Since bitcoin cash is a fork of the bitcoin block chain, its address format previously looked nearly identical to that of bitcoin, which was very confusing to those using it. Now, when you want to send or receive bitcoin cash, you can immediately identify that you’re using the correct address thanks to the added prefix that looks like this: bitcoincash:qpm2qsznhks23z7629mms6s4cwef74vcwvy22gdx6a. Although you can technically still transact to and from legacy BCH addresses, we strongly recommend adopting this new format to eliminate confusion.",

  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer1": "The block chain is a uniquely architected database for digital transactions. To break it down— a block contains a record of new transactions and cnce that block is full, it is added to a chain of other blocks of transactions; hence the name “block chain”. This information is publicly viewable on an explorer, where eventually each transaction is approved or rejected by a network of computers (called miners). The block chain is considered immutable (meaning unchanging) because in order to alter a block, all previous blocks would have to also be altered. The vast majority of the community would have to agree on the change and be willing to update all subsequent blocks.",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.question2": "What is bitcoin?",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer2": "Bitcoin (BTC) is the first ever cryptocurrency and is used like other monetary assets in exchange for goods and services. Unlike traditional assets, bitcoin is easily portable, divisible, and irreversible. Bitcoin increases system efficiency and enables the provision of financial services at a drastically lower cost, giving users more power and freedom.",

  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer3": "Bitcoin cash is a form of peer-to-peer electronic cash that was created after a fork of the Bitcoin block chain in August 2017. Bitcoin cash, or BCH, has since grown to be one of the top cryptocurrencies, along with bitcoin and ether.",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.question4": "What is ether?",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer4": "Ether is a decentralized digital currency, also known as ETH. In addition to being a tradeable cryptocurrency, ether powers the Ethereum network by paying for transaction fees and computational services. Ether is paving the way for a more intelligent financial platform.",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.question5": "What are contract addresses?",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer5": "Contract addresses are programs that execute requirements set by their creators through running “if-this-then-that” conditions coded onto them. These contract codes can come in many forms, such as the transaction of money when certain conditions are met (think: paying artists a royalty fee every time their content is used), or the exchange of goods between parties (think: paying your monthly rent).",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.question6": "Does Blockchain support ERC20 tokens?",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer6": "We currently do not support ERC20 tokens, but we are working on adding this capability in the coming months. If you accidently send/receive funds from an ERC20 token to your Blockchain wallet, the funds will remain in the original address, you just won’t be able to access it on our platform (yet!).",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.question7": "What are ERC20 tokens?",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer7": "ERC-20 protocol is a standardized way of creating new tokens on the Ethereum block chain.",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.question8": "Where does Blockchain stand on hard forks?",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer8.one": "At Blockchain, our priority is always our users. Our view on network upgrades and forks is two-fold. First, we will prioritize user safety throughout any network upgrade or instability above all else. Second, we believe our users should maximally benefit from forks wherever feasible. Meaning, if 2 block chains are formed through a fork, we will follow the chain with the most accumulated difficulty and refer to that chain as the main chain. If we find that the minority chain has significant value, we will make that value available for customers once evaluated. It may be necessary to temporarily suspend outgoing transactions for a period of time while the network is unstable, and if this is the case, you will be sufficiently notified.

  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer9": "Nodes are powerful computers that run software and keep the network intact by approving or rejecting transactions and adding blocks to the chain.",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.question10": "What are miners?",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer10": "We refer to “mining nodes” as miners. Mining nodes group pending transactions into blocks and add them to the block chain. They do this by solving complex mathematical puzzles that come with the software, and include the answer into each block before adding it to the chain of other blocks. When funds are sent, every computer running a mining node receives the same transaction, and multiple people go to approve or deny it. If miners disagree on a transaction, the network automatically rejects the transaction that doesn’t match the rest: preventing fraud. It’s impossible for scammers to manipulate the system this way, since their copy of the block chain wouldn’t match the others, and each transaction has to be agreed upon.",
