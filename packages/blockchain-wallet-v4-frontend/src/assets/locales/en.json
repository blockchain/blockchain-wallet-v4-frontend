If you wish to specify your own fee for bitcoin transactions, you can do so under ‘Customize Fee’.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question3": "What is the difference between a wallet ID and an address?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer3.one": "You can think of your wallet ID as a username that contains numbers, letters, and dashes. It is only used to log into your wallet and should be kept private.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question5": "Why do we generate new addresses for each bitcoin and bitcoin cash transaction?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer5": "Although you can reuse addresses, transacting with the same address makes it easy for people to track your payments history. We alleviate this by using a HD (hierarchical deterministic) framework which provides you endless different addresses to send and receive to for additional security.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question6": "Can an address still receive funds even though it’s no longer displayed under ‘Request’?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer6.one": "Yes. All public addresses generated from your wallet can still receive funds, even if they no longer appear under ‘Request’. As explained",

  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer7.one": "Transactions will appear almost instantly in your transaction feed. Each currency has its own feed, which you can find by clicking on the corresponding currency in the left navigation of your wallet. While your bitcoin and bitcoin cash transactions are considered complete once they have 3 network confirmations, your ether transactions will be considered complete after 12 confirmations.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer7.two": "This typically takes about 30 minutes for bitcoin and bitcoin cash and 5 minutes for ether, but can vary. Until then, your transaction will show up as pending.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question8": "Can my transaction be canceled or reversed?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer8.one": "No, unfortunately we are unable to cancel or reverse any transaction. Even advanced cryptocurrency users can recall an incident when they failed to double-check their transaction details and accidentally sent funds to the wrong recipient, or sent the wrong amount. As unfortunate as it is, cryptocurrency transactions on the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Bitcoin Cash networks are designed to be       irreversible and we have no control over them. Knowing this, it is extremely important to make sure your transaction details are correct before you click send.",

If it is eventually rejected, the funds will remain on the address they were sent from. At this point, we can only recommend that you wait to see if your transaction is accepted into a block. Clicking the ⬆ icon in your transaction feed will relay to you the details of that  transaction through its respective explorer.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer9.three": "Like all wallet providers, Blockchain has no control over the speed of confirmation, and unfortunately cannot expedite transactions. All we can suggest is using an appropriate transaction fee in order to incentivize a miner to include your transaction into a block. This is always dependent upon the network of miners.

  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer10.two": "Watch-only addresses are a useful feature to monitor incoming and outgoing transactions or to keep track of an address for repeated payments like rent. Keep in mind— sending and receiving to the same address makes your transaction history easy to trace.",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer10.three": "Alternatively, you can import a private key from a different wallet provider (which has your public key attached) and spend from it freely within your Blockchain wallet.

  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.question12": "Why did my bitcoin cash address change?",
  "scenes.faq.group.walletfunctionality.answer12.one": "Since bitcoin cash is a fork of the bitcoin block chain, its address format previously looked nearly identical to that of bitcoin, which was very confusing to those using it. Now, when you want to send or receive bitcoin cash, you can immediately identify that you’re using the correct address thanks to the added prefix that looks like this: bitcoincash:qpm2qsznhks23z7629mms6s4cwef74vcwvy22gdx6a.",

Ether is paving the way for a more intelligent financial platform.",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.question5": "What are contract addresses?",
  "scenes.faq.group.educationalresources.answer5": "Contract addresses are programs that execute requirements set by their creators through running “if-this-then-that” conditions coded onto them.

First, we will prioritize user safety throughout any network upgrade or instability above all else. Second, we believe our users should maximally benefit from forks wherever feasible. Meaning, if 2 block chains are formed through a fork, we will follow the chain with the most accumulated difficulty and refer to that chain as the main chain. If we find that the minority chain has significant value, we will make that value available for customers once evaluated. It may be necessary to temporarily suspend outgoing transactions for a period of time while the network is unstable, and if this is the case, you will be sufficiently notified.

They do this by solving complex mathematical puzzles that come with the software, and include the answer into each block before adding it to the chain of other blocks. When funds are sent, every computer running a mining node receives the same transaction,",

If miners disagree on a transaction, the network automatically rejects the transaction that doesn’t match the rest: preventing fraud.
