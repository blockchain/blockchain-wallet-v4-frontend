    question: 'What do I need to do to keep my wallet safe?',
    answer: 'Our Security Center can help you keep your wallet secure and ensure that you can access your funds even if you lose your password - all in less than 5 minutes. A great place to start is to enable 2-Step Verification to help prevent unauthorized access to your wallet and write down your Recovery Phrase to make sure you never lose access to your funds.  We also recommend using a unique, random password that’s at least 16 characters or more.'
