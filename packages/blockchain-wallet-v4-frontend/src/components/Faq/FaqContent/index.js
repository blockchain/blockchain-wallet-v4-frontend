    answer: 'At Blockchain, we’re committed to letting customers maintain full control of their funds. In that spirit, we never see or store your password, so we can’t reset it for you.

Head over to our Security Center to get yours and make sure you store it somewhere secure and never share it.'

    question: 'What do I need to do to keep my wallet safe?',
    answer: 'Our Security Center can help you keep your wallet secure and ensure that you can access your funds even if you lose your password - all in less than 5 minutes. A great place to start is to enable two-factor authentication to help prevent unauthorized access to your wallet and write down your Recovery Phrase to make sure you never lose access to your funds.  We also recommend using a unique, random password that’s at least 16 characters or more.'
